Dependency version numbers are bumped every once in a while to keep the range of properly tested configurations manageable, even if not strictly required to build.
You may be able to build with older versions of (some of) the dependencies other than the minimum versions specified in the build scripts, but support for such builds is not provided - you are on your own.
Please ensure you are building with an officially supported configuration when reporting bugs.
