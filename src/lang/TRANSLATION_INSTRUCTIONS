For future maintainers on how to update translations from Transifex.

Project page: https://explore.transifex.com/sledgehammer999/qbittorrent/

Most of the options are setup in the .tx/config file. You will need to have the Transifex client app in your path.
The examples use the tx app on Windows. Other OSs should be similar.

===Updating the translations===
1. In the root folder of the project just run "tx pull"
2. Commit to git

===Pulling new translation files===
1. In the root folder of the project just run "tx pull -a"
2. Commit to git each translation file separately with its own message.
3. After you commit all new files expose them in app. Edit:
  a. lang.qrc
  b. options_imp.cpp: options_imp::languageToLocalizedString()
  c. src.pro: The TRANSLATIONS var
  d. preferences_content.html: search for: <select id="locale_select">

Note: This will also pull updated translations if you haven't already 'tx pull'.

===Updating the qBittorrent.desktop file===
1. In the root folder of the project just run "tx pull -s -r qbittorrent.qbittorrentdesktop_master"
2. Commit to git

It will pull the source file (en). However, in this case .desktop files contain all other translations
when you pull the source file.

===When making new branch===
1. Switch to new branch
2. Edit the .tx.config file. You should change the resource for the qbt translations from 'qbittorrent.qbittorrent_master'
   to eg 'qbittorrent.qbittorrent_v3_1_x'. It follows this spec: <project>.<resource_slug>_<branchname>'
3. Commit to git
4. Use this command to create the new resource on the server and push the translations files "tx push -s -t"

===Updating the source file==
When you run lupdate Transifex needs to know that the source is updated. When creating a new resource on transifex
you should go to the website, select the resource and hit "edit resource". From there you should update the
"Source file URL". It should point to the exact file in the github repository(eg src/lang/qbittorrent_en.ts). Be sure to copy
the 'raw' link presented by github and not the regular one. This will make Transifex fetch automatically the source file
from the repo (maybe once a day). If you want to instantly update the resource then on the correct branch run "tx push -s"
