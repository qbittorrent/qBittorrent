# qBittorrent Icons
------------------------------------------

## Previous
Old icons were created by Bert Verhelst (<verhelstbert@gmail.com>).
Icons were based on the [Font-Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) icon set.
## Redesign
Redesigned icons are created by Nowshed H. Imran (<nowshed.imran@gmail.com>).
New icons are based on [la-capitaine-icon-theme](https://github.com/keeferrourke/la-capitaine-icon-theme) and [ionicons](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionicons).
`la-capitaine` project is owned by Keefer Rourke and due permission was received before modifying them.
`ionicons` project is under MIT license and thus it can be used freely.
Both of these projects can be used as reference for future icon designs.
