- [ ] I have read the **issue reporting section** in the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), so I know how to submit a good bug report with the required information
- [ ] I have verified that the **issue is not fixed and is reproducible** in the **[latest version](https://www.qbittorrent.org/download.php)**
- [ ] (optional but recommended) I have verified that the **issue is not fixed and is reproducible** in the **[latest CI build](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/actions/workflows/ci.yaml?query=branch%3Amaster+event%3Apush)**
- [ ] I have **checked the [frequent/common issues list](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/projects/2)** and **searched** the issue tracker for similar bug reports (including closed ones) **to avoid posting a duplicate**

The [wiki](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/wiki) did not contain a suitable solution either
- [ ] I have **pasted/attached the settings file and relevant log(s)** in the **Attachments** section at the bottom of the report. Mandatory: the settings file and at least the most recent log. See [this wiki page](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#Where_does_qBittorrent_save_its_settings) if you're not sure where to find them.
