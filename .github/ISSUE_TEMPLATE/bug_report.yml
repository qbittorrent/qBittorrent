        #### ADVISORY
        "We do not support any versions older than the current release series"

        "We do not support any 3rd party/forked versions e.g. `portableapps`/`Enhanced Edition`etc."

        "Please post all details in **English**."

        #### Prerequisites before submitting an issue!
        - Read the issue reporting section in the **[contributing guidelines](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)**, to know how to submit a good bug report with the required information.
        - Verify that the issue is not fixed and is reproducible in the **[latest official qBittorrent version](https://www.qbittorrent.org/download.php).**
        - (Optional, but recommended) Verify that the issue is not fixed and is reproducible in the latest CI (currently only on **[Windows](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/actions/workflows/ci_windows.yaml?query=branch%3Amaster+event%3Apush)**) builds.
        - Check the **[frequent/common issues list](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/projects/2)** and perform a **[search of the issue tracker (including closed ones)](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/issues)** to avoid posting a duplicate.
        - Make sure this is not a support request or question, both of which are better suited for either the **[discussions section](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/discussions)**, **[forum](https://qbforums.shiki.hu/)**, or **[subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/qBittorrent/)**.
        - Verify that the **[wiki](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/wiki)** did not contain a suitable solution either.
        - If relevant to issue/when asked, the qBittorrent preferences file, qBittorrent.log & watched_folders.json (if using "Watched Folders" feature) must be provided.
          See **[Where does qBittorrent save its settings?](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#Where_does_qBittorrent_save_its_settings)**
