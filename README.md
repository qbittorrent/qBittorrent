### Description:
qBittorrent is a bittorrent client programmed in C++ / Qt that uses
libtorrent (sometimes called libtorrent-rasterbar) by Arvid Norberg.

It aims to be a good alternative to all other bittorrent clients
out there. qBittorrent is fast, stable and provides unicode
support as well as many features.

This product includes GeoLite data created by MaxMind, available from
