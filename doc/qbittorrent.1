.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]qBittorrent\f[R] is an advanced BitTorrent client written in C++ /
Qt, using the \f[B]libtorrent-rasterbar\f[R] library by Arvid Norberg as
the backend.
qBittorrent provides a familiar, easy-to-use GUI, and is fast, stable
and light.
.PP
qBittorrent supports several important modern features and BEPs
(BitTorrent Enhancement Proposals) such as UPnP port forwarding /
NAT-PMP, DHT (Mainline) and magnet URI (also known as magnet link)
support, IPv6, uTP, PeX, LSD, UDP tracker protocol support and more.
Refer to the \f[B]libtorrent-rasterbar\f[R] documentation for the full
list of features and supported BEPs.
.PP
In addition, qBittorrent supports Unicode and it provides a good
integrated Python-based torrent search engine, an RSS downloader, a
torrent creation GUI, a basic embedded tracker to facilitate sharing
torrents with friends, and an HTTP API/Web UI combo for remote
access/administration.
.PP
When qBittorrent is started from a terminal, its \f[B]stdout\f[R] and
\f[B]stderr\f[R] will be attached to that terminal.
.PP
If no arguments are specified, qBittorrent simply starts and shows the
GUI.
.PP
If either \f[B]\f[CB]-h\f[B]\f[R] or \f[B]\f[CB]-v\f[B]\f[R] is
specified, the relevant information is printed to the terminal and
qBittorrent exits.
Passing any other option alongside \f[B]\f[CB]-h\f[B]\f[R] or
\f[B]\f[CB]-v\f[B]\f[R] is not allowed.
.PP
\f[I]URI\f[R] is a string pointing to a BitTorrent metainfo file (a
\[lq]torrent\[rq]).
It may be a path to a file on disk or an online resource accessible
through a supported URI scheme such as \f[B]magnet\f[R], \f[B]HTTP\f[R],
or \f[B]HTTPS\f[R].
.PP
Standalone \f[B]info-hashes\f[R] are also accepted as shorthand for a
bare-bones \f[B]magnet\f[R] \f[I]URI\f[R] constructed from that
\f[B]info-hash\f[R].
For example, passing the \f[B]info-hash\f[R]
\f[I]\f[CI]e73108cbd628fee5cf203acdf668c5bf45d07810\f[I]\f[R] (for the
file \f[C]ubuntu-18.04.4-live-server-amd64.iso\f[R]) is the same as
passing the \f[B]magnet\f[R] \f[I]URI\f[R]
\f[I]\f[CI]magnet:?xt=urn:btih:e73108cbd628fee5cf203acdf668c5bf45d07810\f[I]\f[R].
.PP
By default, any \f[I]URI\f[R] passed as an argument will be downloaded
if needed, and then shown in an \[lq]Add New Torrent\[rq] dialog to be
added to the transfer list.
.PP
\f[I]OPTIONS\f[R] control general program settings, such as the port the
WebUI should listen on, as well as settings for the torrents to be
added, if any, such as their save path.
In addition, the \[lq]Add New Torrent\[rq] dialog can be entirely
skipped, to just automatically add the torrents wihthout confirmation
with the specified settings.
.PP
Some \f[I]OPTIONS\f[R] have both a long form
(\f[B]\f[CB]--option\f[B]\f[R]) and a short form
(\f[B]\f[CB]-o\f[B]\f[R]), others only have one of the two.
.PP
\f[I]OPTIONS\f[R] can be passed in from several sources.
If the same option is specified in multiple sources, the last one takes
precedence, in the following order:
.IP "1." 3
The main configuration file (see the \f[I]FILES\f[R] section)
.IP "2." 3
\f[I]ENVIRONMENT\f[R] variables
.IP "3." 3
Command-line \f[I]OPTIONS\f[R]
.PP
\f[B]IMPORTANT NOTE:\f[R] Settings changed via command-line
\f[I]OPTIONS\f[R] or \f[I]ENVIRONMENT\f[R] variables not only
\f[B]override\f[R] their corresponding values in the configuration file,
they \f[B]also overwrite\f[R] them.
.PP
\f[I]ENVIRONMENT\f[R] variables and command-line \f[I]OPTIONS\f[R] can
currently only override a small subset of all the available settings
that can be configured in the main configuration file.
.PP
qBittorrent can be cleanly terminated by fully closing the GUI
(including the system tray, if that option is enabled) or by sending the
\f[B]SIGINT\f[R] or \f[B]SIGTERM\f[R] signals to its process.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS Generic program information
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]-h\f[B]\f[R], \f[B]\f[CB]--help\f[B]\f[R]
Display a short help text about the command-line options and exit.
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]-v\f[B]\f[R], \f[B]\f[CB]--version\f[B]\f[R]
Display program version and exit.
.SS General configuration
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]--configuration=\f[B]\f[R]\f[I]NAME\f[R]
Use a different configuration with name \f[I]NAME\f[R].
This makes it possible to save and use different configurations for
different scenarios.
It can also be leveraged to run multiple separate instances of
qBittorrent at the same time without conflict (provided they don\[cq]t
listen on the same ports for WebUI access, incoming connections, etc; if
this is not guaranteed, then, as expected, the additional instances will
either fail to start or be functionally unusable).
.RS
.PP
Configuration and data files will be stored under a configuration
hierarchy similar to the default one (see the \f[I]FILES\f[R] section
for more information) but with a final directory named
\f[B]qBittorrent_\f[BI]NAME\f[B]\f[R] instead of \f[B]qBittorrent\f[R].
.PP
For example, while the main configuration file is stored as
\f[I]\[ti]/.config/qBittorrent/qBittorrent.conf\f[R], the configuration
file for a configuration named \f[B]foo\f[R] will be stored as
\f[I]\[ti]/.config/qBittorrent_\f[BI]foo\f[I]/qBittorrent.conf\f[R].
.PP
If a configuration with the given \f[I]NAME\f[R] does not exist yet, it
is created with default settings.
If it already exists, it is loaded as a normal configuration would be.
.PP
See the documentation for the \f[B]\f[CB]--profile\f[B]\f[R] option to
know what happens if both options are supplied at the same time.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]--no-splash\f[B]\f[R]
Do not display the splash screen on startup.
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]--profile=\f[B]\f[R]\f[I]PATH\f[R]
Store configuration \f[I]FILES\f[R] in \f[I]PATH\f[R].
Similarly to \f[B]\f[CB]--configuration\f[B]\f[R], this option makes it
possible to save and use different configurations, and can be leveraged
to run multiple separate instances of qBittorrent at the same time
without conflitcts (the same caveats about listening port conflicts and
other potential unavoidable conflicts apply).
.RS
.PP
The difference is that configuration files are all stored together under
the specified configuration \f[I]PATH\f[R], instead of scattered under a
separate directory hierarchy in the system\[cq]s configuration
directories (see the \f[I]FILES\f[R] section for more information).
.PP
If a special directory literally named \f[B]\f[CB]profile\f[B]\f[R]
exists in the \f[I]same directory as the qBittorrent executable\f[R],
executing qBittorrent with no \f[B]\f[CB]--profile=\f[B]\f[R] option is
the same as executing qBittorrent from the qBittorrent executable
directory with the options
\f[B]\f[CB]--profile=profile --relative-fastresume\f[B]\f[R].
This special case is known as the \[lq]portable mode\[rq] in
qBittorrent.
Note that if this special directory is present in the qBittorrent
executable directory, but a non-empty \f[B]\f[CB]--profile=\f[B]\f[R] is
specified, the command line option will take precedence and
\f[B]\f[CB]--relative-fastresume\f[B]\f[R] will not be implied.
Specifying a non-empty \f[B]\f[CB]--profile=\f[B]\f[R] together with
\f[B]\f[CB]--relative-fastresume\f[B]\f[R] explicitly is functionally
equivalent to the \[lq]portable mode\[rq], but under a profile directory
of choice, other than the special directory described above.
.PP
If \f[I]PATH\f[R] does not exist, it is created, with configuration
files initialized with default settings inside it that a new instance of
qBittorrent then loads.
If it exists, the configurations are loaded from there.
.PP
A relative \f[I]PATH\f[R] may be used, in which case it will be relative
to the current working directory that qBittorrent is started from.
Note that \f[B]\f[CB]\[ti]\f[B]\f[R] will not get expanded, and will be
interpreted as a directory literally named \f[B]\f[CB]\[ti]\f[B]\f[R].
.PP
\f[B]Keep in mind that there are some caveats when using this option,
with regards to the portability of profiles between machines:\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
In general, the \f[I].fastresume\f[R] files stored in the
\f[I]BT_backup\f[R] directory are not portable between machines, unless
they were generated by a qBittorrent instance started with
\f[B]\f[CB]--relative-fastresume\f[B]\f[R], and the savepaths are able
to be represented in a relative form (i.e.\ no paths to a different disk
or UNC paths on Windows).
Note that \f[B]\f[CB]--relative-fastresume\f[B]\f[R] does not change
anything in the \f[I].fastresume\f[R] files of previously added
torrents.
See the \f[I]FILES\f[R] section for more information about the
\f[I]BT_backup\f[R] directory and the files stored within it.
.IP \[bu] 2
Path-related settings stored in the main configuration file (such as
save paths) might represent paths which are not be present on the target
machine, and thus may need to be adjusted after migrating.
.PP
If both \f[B]\f[CB]--configuration\f[B]\f[R] and
\f[B]\f[CB]--profile\f[B]\f[R] are specified, the configuration files
will be stored under a directory named according to the naming rules
described for \f[B]\f[CB]--configuration\f[B]\f[R], and this directory
will in turn be nested under the \f[I]PATH\f[R] supplied to
\f[B]\f[CB]--profile\f[B]\f[R].
.RE
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]--relative-fastresume\f[B]\f[R]
\f[B]Don\[cq]t use this option explicitly unless you know you need it.
If you have to ask, you don\[cq]t need it.\f[R]
.RS
.PP
Make the paths of torrents\[cq] files stored in the
\f[I].fastresume\f[R] files be relative to the
\f[B]\f[CB]--profile\f[B]\f[R] directory.
.PP
If used explicitly without \f[B]\f[CB]--profile\f[B]\f[R], paths will be
relative to the directory specfied by the \f[B]HOME\f[R] enviroment
variable instead, which is the home directory of the current user by
default.
.PP
Implied when running in \[lq]portable mode\[rq], refer to the
documentation of the \f[B]\f[CB]--profile\f[B]\f[R] option to learn
more.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]--webui-port=\f[B]\f[R]\f[I]NUMBER\f[R]
Specify the port \f[I]NUMBER\f[R] the WebUI should listen on.
The default if not specified is 8080.
.SS Options to control added torrents
.PP
These options only apply to the added torrents passed in
[\f[I]URI\f[R]\&...].
If no torrent is specified, these options are ignored.
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]--add-paused=\f[B]\f[R]\f[I]TOGGLE\f[R]
\f[I]TOGGLE\f[R] is one of \f[B]true\f[R] or \f[B]false\f[R].
If \f[B]true\f[R], the torrent(s) will not be automatically started.
Defaults to \f[B]false\f[R].
Note that if a torrent\[cq]s files exist in the destination save path, a
recheck will start, unless \f[B]\f[CB]--skip-hash-check\f[B]\f[R] is
used.
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]--category=\f[B]\f[R]\f[I]NAME\f[R]
Assign the torrent(s) to the category \f[I]NAME\f[R].
If this category does not exist, it will be automatically created.
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]--first-and-last\f[B]\f[R]
Download first and last pieces first.
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]--save-path=\f[B]\f[R]\f[I]PATH\f[R]
Save the torrent(s) to the specified \f[I]PATH\f[R].
A relative \f[I]PATH\f[R] may be used, in which case it will be relative
to the current working directory that qBittorrent is started from.
Note that \f[B]\f[CB]\[ti]\f[B]\f[R] will not get expanded, and will be
interpreted as a directory literally named \f[B]\f[CB]\[ti]\f[B]\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]--sequential\f[B]\f[R]
Download pieces in sequential order.
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]--skip-dialog=\f[B]\f[R]\f[I]TOGGLE\f[R]
\f[I]TOGGLE\f[R] is one of \f[B]true\f[R] or \f[B]false\f[R].
If \f[B]true\f[R], the \[lq]Add New Torrent\[rq] dialog will not be
shown when adding torrents.
Defaults to \f[B]false\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]--skip-hash-check\f[B]\f[R]
By default, if a torrent\[cq]s files exist in the destination save path,
a recheck is initiated.
This option prevents that from happening, which is not recommended in
general.
Torrents may still be force-rechecked after they are added, as usual.
If the torrent\[cq]s files do not exist in the destination save path,
this option has no effect.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
\f[I]OPTIONS\f[R] may be supplied via environment variables with
equivalent names.
.PP
For an option named \f[B]parameter-name\f[R], the corresponding
environment variable name is \f[B]QBT_PARAMETER_NAME\f[R].
In other words, the parameter name is converted to upper-case, any
hyphens (\f[B]-\f[R]) are replaced by underscores (\f[B]_\f[R]), and
\f[B]QBT_\f[R] is prepended to it.
.PP
To pass flag values, set the variable to \f[B]1\f[R] or \f[B]TRUE\f[R].
For example, \f[B]\f[CB]--add-paused=true\f[B]\f[R] becomes
\f[B]QBT_ADD_PAUSED=1\f[R]
.SH FILES
.SS Standard configuration files directory hierarchy
.PP
Currently, qBittorrent complies somewhat with the Freedesktop XDG Base
Directory specification.
The configuration files are stored in the default directories of the
specification:
.IP "1." 3
Configuration files are stored in \f[I]\[ti]/.config/qBittorrent\f[R]
.IP "2." 3
Data files are stored in \f[I]\[ti]/.local/share/data/qBittorrent\f[R]
.IP "3." 3
Cache is stored in \f[I]\[ti]/.cache/qBittorrent\f[R]
.PP
However, qBittorrent will not use custom XDG paths set via the
\f[B]$XDG_CONFIG_HOME\f[R] environment variables and the like; it will
always use the default ones.
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]--configuration\f[B]\f[R] and
\f[B]\f[CB]--profile\f[B]\f[R] options will instruct qBittorrent to
create/use configuration files in different locations, instead of the
default ones.
Refer to the documentation of each of these options to learn more.
.SS Files used by qBittorrent
.PP
This is a list of the files qBittorrent creates and uses for normal
operation.
While the name and purpose of these files is unlikely to change, the
file formats themselves are not stable, and thus intentionally not
documented here.
Depending on what features are used, some files may not exist.
They are only created when needed.
.TP
\f[I]\[ti]/.config/qBittorrent/qBittorrent.conf\f[R]
Main configuration file.
.TP
\f[I]\[ti]/.config/qBittorrent/qBittorrent-data.conf\f[R]
This is where all-time statistics are saved.
.TP
\f[I]\[ti]/.config/qBittorrent/rss/feeds.json\f[R]
RSS feeds configuration.
.TP
\f[I]\[ti]/.config/qBittorrent/rss/download_rules.json\f[R]
RSS auto-downloading rules configuration file.
.TP
\f[I]\[ti]/.local/share/data/qBittorrent/BT_backup/\f[R]
This directory contains the \f[I].fastresume\f[R] files, which is the
mechanism qBittorrent uses to keep track of the state of each added
torrent across restarts.
In addition, a copy of each of the added torrents\[cq] metainfo files is
kept here, with the torrents\[cq] hashes as the file names.
.TP
\f[I]\[ti]/.local/share/data/qBittorrent/GeoDB/\f[R]
Database files for IP <-> country flag resolution in the \[lq]Peers\[rq]
tab.
.TP
\f[I]\[ti]/.local/share/data/qBittorrent/logs/\f[R]
Execution logs.
.TP
\f[I]\[ti]/.local/share/data/qBittorrent/nova3/\f[R]
Python files for the Search Engine functionality.
.TP
\f[I]\[ti]/.local/share/data/qBittorrent/nova3/engines/\f[R]
Custom search engine code and files.
.TP

RSS articles lock file.
.TP
\f[I]/tmp/qtsingleapp-qBitto-\f[BI]<app_id_string>\f[I]-lockfile\f[R]
Per-configuration application instance lock file.
Each application instance with a different
\f[B]\f[CB]--configuration\f[B]\f[R] or \f[B]\f[CB]--profile\f[B]\f[R]
has a different \f[B]<app_id_string>\f[R].
Two instances with the same configuration cannot run at the same time.
