\fBqBittorrent-nox\fR is an advanced command-line Bittorrent client written in C++ / Qt4,
using the \fBlibtorrent-rasterbar\fR library by Arvid Norberg. qBittorrent\-nox aims
to be a good alternative to other command line bittorrent clients and provides features similar to popular graphical clients.

qBittorrent\-nox is fast, stable, light and it supports unicode. 
It also comes with UPnP port forwarding / NAT-PMP, encryption (Vuze compatible), 
FAST extension (mainline) and PeX support (utorrent compatible).
